					<h3 class="h3-about">Female Coder</h3>
					<img src="shecodes.jpg" alt="She Codes Art Logo" class="shecodes">
					<p class="about-descricao">I'm learning how to code, and as a woman, I know that I am a minority in this field. You can see the difference in women's participation in programming in the <a href="#table-stackoverflow" class="link-table">table below</a>, which shows the gender profile of (about 67,000) developers.
					</p> 
					<p class="about-descricao">But there are people working to make things more diverse, and one of them is She Codes Art. They're a non profit that teaches computer science to underrepresented minorities and they joined efforts with Mantra and Co to produce computer science inspired jewelry. It's pretty neat.

					<h3 class="h3-about">Psychologist</h3>
					<img src="psychology.svg"	alt="hand drawn humam brain decorated with flowers and butterflies" class="psychology">
					<p class="about-descricao">I am a psychology graduate from the University of Bras√≠lia. And even without making a career out of it, this will always be a &lt;lovely&gt; part of me. About this topic I'd like to add that mental health is extremely important, and despite all our efforts in education and how far we've come, mental illness is still very stigmatized.</p>
					<p class="about-descricao">To deal with this problem specifically in the tech environment, the <abbr title="Open Sourcing Mental Illness">OSMI</abbr> was founded in 2013. They provide resources for both employer and employee.

					<h3 class="h3-about">24601</h3>
					<img src="music.svg" alt="notes on a music score" class="music">
					<p class="about-descricao">Who Am I? I am a amateur singer and a musical lover. This particular phrase (who am I? 24601) is a quote from the musical Les Miserables. Which I highly recommend by the way, as it is one the best musicals ever created.
					</p>
					<p class="about-descricao">I've studied a little big of singing and participated in choirs while in university. Before that I performed many plays at high school and I danced Flamenco semi-professionally (as in, I occasionally got paid) in a dance company called Capricho Espanhol.
					</p>
					<p class="about-descricao">So, who knows? Maybe in a parallel universe I'm a extremely happy artist. But in this one, this is just a hobby.
